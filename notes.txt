[0.6] The multiverse update

Features:
- Configurations are now loaded on a per-world basis

Bugfixes:
- Fixed a bug where events happening in non-bloodmoon worlds were still treated as part of a bloodmoon
- Fixed the default config file

Misc:
- Unit tests have been implemented to increase overall release quality

Notes:
- Plugin name internally changed from Bloodmoon to BloodMoon, and thus, the plugin folder's name is now changed, at least on Linux. Since
Windows handles capital letters in filenames differently, I am unsure if you need to manually transfer your config files
- The old BloodMoon/config.yml is deprecated, so simply copy your configs to the new config files. Please review the newly generated config
file, as there was some slight changes in the config file structure
